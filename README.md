   - **Description**: A method for establishing covert communication channels over TCP.
   - **Usage**: Essential for understanding how data can be exfiltrated without detection.

7. **Exploit Database**
   - **Description**: A collection of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software.
   - **Usage**: A vital resource for finding known vulnerabilities to test against.

8. **Fatrat**
   - **Description**: A post-exploitation framework that provides various tools to manage compromised systems.
   - **Usage**: Useful for understanding persistence mechanisms and post-exploitation scenarios.

9. **FuzzingPy**
   - **Description**: A tool for fuzz testing applications to find vulnerabilities.
   - **Usage**: Demonstrates the importance of input validation and how improper handling can lead to security flaws.

10. **Hashdump**
    - **Description**: A tool used to extract password hashes from the target system.
    - **Usage**: Critical for understanding how attackers retrieve credentials for further exploitation.

11. **Meterpreter**
    - **Description**: A powerful payload within Metasploit that allows for advanced post-exploitation capabilities.
    - **Usage**: Enables attackers to interact with the target system and gather intelligence.

12. **NTLM**
    - **Description**: A Microsoft authentication protocol used to securely authenticate users.
    - **Usage**: Understanding NTLM can help in assessing vulnerabilities related to authentication processes.

13. **PowerSpy**
    - **Description**: A tool for monitoring and capturing keystrokes and other sensitive information on a target system.
    - **Usage**: Illustrates the techniques of information gathering through keylogging.

14. **Timestomp**
    - **Description**: A tool used to manipulate file timestamps to evade detection.
    - **Usage**: Helpful in understanding how attackers cover their tracks by altering file attributes.

15. **VulnServer**
